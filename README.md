This repository hosts an image classification project aimed at identifying various species of flowers. The project utilizes TensorFlow, a powerful open-source library for machine learning, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the publicly available Flowers dataset from TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS). The model is trained to distinguish between different types of flowers based on their images, showcasing the capability of CNNs in handling image data.
Dataset: Utilizes the TFDS Flowers dataset, comprising images of various flower species.
Model Architecture: Implements a straightforward yet effective CNN architecture for image classification tasks.
Training and Validation: Involves a detailed process of training the model on the dataset, including splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model's effectiveness.
Evaluation: Includes a step-by-step evaluation of the model's performance using accuracy as a metric, providing insights into its predictive capabilities.
Visualization: Features visual output of the model's predictions on test data, comparing predicted labels against true labels to visually assess performance.
